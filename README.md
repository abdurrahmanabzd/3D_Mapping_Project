# Localization Project

The robot will navigate its way using the move_base ROS package and then localize itself with Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm. 
***NOTE: Make sure to name the package "my_robot" after cloning the files. The code written will be looking for "my_robot" files not "Localization_Project".
